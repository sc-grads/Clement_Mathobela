#Coding Exercise 2:

# Create a list, called my_list, with three numbers. The total of the numbers added together should be 100.
my_list = [50,25,25]
# Create a tuple, called my_tuple, with a single value in it
my_tuple = (1,)
# Modify set2 so that set1.intersection(set2) returns {5, 77, 9, 12}
set1 = {14, 5, 9, 31, 12, 77, 67, 8}
set2 = {5,77,9,12}
